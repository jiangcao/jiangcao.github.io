## Academic Experience 

**Tyndall National Institute**, Ireland
**Researcher (non-tenure)**                        **2017 - present**
Studying the electronic transport properties of PbTe using first-principles and Boltzmann transport equations.

**Université Grenoble Alpes**, France
**PhD Research**                                   **2013 - 2016**
Studying the mechanisms of transport in 2-D material tunnel FET

Results: Developed Fortran codes parallelized with OpenMP for quantum
transport NEGF simulations, used it to predict the performances of
vertical tunnel FETs based on 2-D gapped materials, explained the
fundamental aspects of the device working principle and studied the role
of several design parameters.

**Teaching Assistant**                              **2014 - 2016**
Co-taught undergraduate level courses for the electrical engineering
students. Shared responsibility for lab works, tutorials, exams,
homework assignments, and grades.

- Electronic Circuit, Autumn 2014 and 2015
- Microprocessor and Assembly Language, Spring 2015 and 2016
- Physics, Spring 2016

**INSA de Lyon**, France

**Teaching Assistant**                               **2010 - 2011**
Duties included leading tutorial exercises for undergraduates, and
fielding of student questions.

- Physics, Autumn 2010
